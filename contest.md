Hello,

In the interest of shining a spotlight on the coding talents on Nairaland, we are conducting a series of challenges.

The first one is a 3D Ludo Game challenge. This requires you to use AI to help you create an enjoyable Ludo game in a single html file using three.js via CDN to display the game in 3D. The Ludo rules are up to you to decide but must be made clear to the users.

Steps:
Develop the game as specified (single html file) using git for source control.
Push the source code to a private github repo before the deadline.
After the deadline, make the github repo public and post it on this thread for assessment.
If you touch or make any change to the repo after the deadline, you'll be disqualified.

Tips:
Use a powerful AI Like Gemini 3 Pro (free on Google AI Studio and Google Antigravity) for planning.
You will be graded based on everything that makes your game superior to other entries.
Such as the unique features (very important), code quality, UI, and the sweetness of the game.

The prize for the best entry is N250,000. The runner-up gets: N125,000.
The deadline is 10:00am Nigerian time on Thursday, the 18th of December, 2025.

Good luck!
Seun (Founder, Nairaland)
