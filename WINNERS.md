Hello,

We were unable to pick an outright winner in this contest. No entry gave us 100% of what we were looking for. Some had the best gameplay. Others had the nicest looking boards. Others had the two dice system which is less tedious. Some were bug-free. Some had keyboard support.

No entry had all of the above, for 2 reasons:
1) We didn't want to provide detailed requirements because that would amount to writing your prompts for you in an AI contest.
2) We only gave you 48 hours. That was enough for working prototypes, but bugs can creep in when you're in a hurry.

We tried a point based system through human and AI judges but alas, the results were inconsistent. So we decided to go for "sweetness". Using this evaluation method, we were able to find 3 entries which were clearly better than the others, but we couldn't pick a winner among them.

I'm pleased to announce the 3 co-winners of this contest:
- Techtoyin: https://www.github.com/Tpepper2001/Ludo-challenge (sweetest double dice game)
- Horladoyin: https://www.github.com/Horladoyin/Ludo-3D (sweetest single dice game)
- Vikkkilee: https://www.github.com/vicosmaster/NAIRALUDO (prettiest board, sweet keyboard support)

We expanded the prizes from N375k for 1st and 2nd place to ₦540k for the first 3 (₦180k each).

Shoutout to BelloP, who had a very fun piece movement system. And Uromgoodluck, whose board was very pretty. There are others...
